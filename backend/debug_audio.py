        Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of machine learning 
        applications in healthcare. We analyze various algorithms including 
        support vector machines, random forests, and deep neural networks. 
        Our results demonstrate that ensemble methods achieve the highest 
        accuracy in disease prediction tasks. The study involved 10,000 
        patient records and achieved 94.2% accuracy in the final evaluation.
        
        Introduction: Machine learning has revolutionized healthcare by enabling 
        early disease detection and personalized treatment plans. Recent advances 
        in deep learning have shown promising results in medical image analysis 
        and patient outcome prediction.
        
        Methods: We collected data from multiple hospitals and applied various 
        preprocessing techniques. Feature engineering was performed using domain 
        expertise and statistical analysis. Cross-validation was used to ensure 
        robust model evaluation.
        
        Results: Our experiments show that random forest algorithms achieve 
        94.2% accuracy in disease prediction, outperforming other methods. 
        Deep learning models show similar performance but require more 
        computational resources.
        
        Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms show great promise in healthcare 
        applications. Future work will focus on real-time deployment and 
        integration with existing medical systems.
