# PDF Parsing and Audio Generation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PDF Parsing Issues
- **Problem**: PDF files were returning garbled binary content like `%PDF-1.5 % 147 0 obj...`
- **Root Cause**: `pdfminer.high_level.extract_text()` was failing on certain PDFs and returning raw binary data
- **Solution**: 
  - Added multiple fallback methods for PDF text extraction
  - Implemented validation to detect garbled/binary content
  - Added better error handling and user-friendly error messages

### 2. Audio Generation Issues
- **Problem**: Audio was not generating when PDF parsing failed
- **Root Cause**: Audio agent was trying to process garbled text from failed PDF parsing
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced error detection in audio agent
  - Skip audio generation for error messages and garbled content
  - Better text cleaning for TTS processing

### 3. Summary Generation Issues
- **Problem**: Summaries were showing "Summary (fallback): %PDF-1.5..." for failed PDFs
- **Root Cause**: Summarizer was falling back to simple text truncation without validation
- **Solution**:
  - Added comprehensive text validation
  - Implemented meaningful fallback summaries
  - Better error messages for different failure scenarios

## Files Modified

1. **`agents/parser_agent.py`**
   - Enhanced `read_pdf()` function with multiple extraction methods
   - Added `extract_text_manual()` for fallback extraction
   - Added `is_valid_text()` for content validation

2. **`agents/summarizer_agent.py`**
   - Improved `generate_summary()` with better error handling
   - Added `clean_text_for_summarization()` for text preprocessing
   - Added `is_garbled_text()` for content validation
   - Added `create_fallback_summary()` for meaningful fallbacks

3. **`agents/audio_agent.py`**
   - Enhanced error detection for various error message patterns
   - Better handling of invalid text content

4. **`main.py`**
   - Added file type validation for uploads
   - Better error responses for PDF processing failures

5. **`requirements.txt`**
   - Added `pdfminer.six` dependency

## Installation

To install the missing dependency:

```bash
cd backend
pip install pdfminer.six
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:

```bash
cd backend
python test_pdf_fix.py
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fixes:
- PDF uploads returned garbled binary content
- Summaries showed "Summary (fallback): %PDF-1.5..."
- Audio generation failed or created empty files
- No clear error messages for users

### After Fixes:
- PDF uploads return meaningful error messages for unreadable files
- Summaries provide clear error messages or meaningful fallback content
- Audio generation is skipped for error cases with clear feedback
- Better user experience with informative error messages

## Error Handling

The system now handles these scenarios:

1. **Corrupted PDFs**: Returns "Unable to extract text from PDF. The file may be corrupted, password-protected, or contain only images."

2. **Image-only PDFs**: Returns clear error message about content type

3. **Password-protected PDFs**: Returns appropriate error message

4. **Non-PDF files**: Returns "Only PDF files are supported"

5. **Empty or invalid content**: Returns "Document contains insufficient readable content for summarization"

## Audio Generation Logic

Audio generation now:
- Skips generation for error messages
- Skips generation for garbled/binary content
- Provides clear feedback when skipped
- Only generates audio for valid, meaningful text content
